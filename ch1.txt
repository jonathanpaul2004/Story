To end this command, you're likely referring to the process of making a Git commit. After adding your changes to the staging area using `git add`, you would typically use the following commands to commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

Replace `"Your commit message"` with a brief description of the changes you've made in this commit. This helps others understand the purpose of the commit. The `git push` command then pushes your committed changes to the remote repository, typically hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
